# 3DBM

3D Building Metrics. Elevating geometric analysis for urban morphology, solar potential, CFD etc to the next level ðŸ˜‰

## Installation

You need to install all dependencies first:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then take your time and install [pymesh](https://pymesh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

## Wat is het?

A cool script that computes a lot metrics from 3D geometries (mostly intended for buildings).

The following metrics are computed:

| Type | Metrics |
| --- | --- |
| Geometric Properties | Number of vertices, Number of surfaces, Number of vertices by semantic type (i.e. ground, roof, wall), Number of surfaces by semantic type (i.e. ground, roof, wall), Min/Max/Range/Mean/Median/Std/Mode height |
| Derived Properties | Footprint perimeter, Volume, Volume of convex hull, Volume of Object-Oriented Bounding Box, Volume of Axis-Oriented Bounding Box, Volume of voxelised building, Length and width of the Object-Oriented Bounding Box, Surface area, Surface area by semantic surface, Horizontal elongation, Min/Max vertical elongation, Form factor |
| Spatial distribution | Shared walls, Nearest neighbour |
| Shape indices | Circularity/Hemisphericality<sup>\*</sup>, Convexity 2D/3D<sup>\*</sup>, Fractality 2D/3D<sup>\*</sup>, Rectangularity/Cuboidness<sup>\*</sup>, Squareness/Cubeness<sup>\*</sup>, Cohesion 2D/3D<sup>\*</sup>, Proximity 2D/3D<sup>+</sup>, Exchange 2D/3D<sup>+</sup>, Spin 2D/3D<sup>+</sup>, Perimeter/Circumference<sup>\*</sup>, Depth 2D/3D<sup>+</sup>, Girth 2D/3D<sup>+</sup>, Dispersion 2D/3D<sup>x</sup>, Range 2D/3D<sup>\*</sup>, Equivalent Rectangular/Cuboid<sup>\*</sup>, Roughness<sup>x</sup> |

- <sup>\*</sup> formula-based index, size-independent by definition
- <sup>+</sup> index based on interior grid points (discretised), normalised
- <sup>x</sup> index based on surface grid points (discretised), normalised

## Omg, how amazing! Any issues?

Yeah:
- It works with only `MultiSurface` and `Solid` (the latter, only for the first shell)
- It only parses the first geometry
- Expects semantic surfaces

## How?

Running it, saving it, and including a [val3dity](https://github.com/tudelft3d/val3dity) report:

```
python cityStats.py [file_path] -o [output.csv] [-v val3dity_report.json]
```

Default is single-threaded, define the number of threads with:

```
python cityStats.py [file_path] -j [number]
```

Visualising a specific building, which can help with troubleshooting:

```
python cityStats.py [file_path] -p -f [unique_id]
```

Running multiple files in a folder and checking with [val3dity](https://github.com/tudelft3d/val3dity) (make sure you have val3dity installed):

```
for i in *.json; do val3dity $i --report "${i%.json}_v3.json"; python cityStats.py $i -o "${i%.json}.csv" -v "${i%.json}_v3.json"; done
```

## Can I visualise a model?

Tuurlijk! Just:

```
python cityPlot.py [file_path]
```

## Tutorial please!

1) Download or `git clone` this repository.

2) Install all dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3) Download a tile from 3D BAG: `wget --header='Accept-Encoding: gzip' https://data.3dbag.nl/cityjson/v210908_fd2cee53/3dbag_v210908_fd2cee53_5910.json`

4) Run the stats on the data: `python cityStats.py 3dbag_v210908_fd2cee53_5910.json -o 5910.csv`

5) The resutling file `5910.csv` contains all metrics computed for this tile.

You may also run this with a [val3dity](http://geovalidation.bk.tudelft.nl/val3dity/) report. You may download the val3dity report as a json file from the aforementioned website. Assuming the report's filename is `report.json` you can run:

```
python cityStats.py 3dbag_v210908_fd2cee53_5910.json -v report.json -o 5910.csv
```

Then the result will contain more info related to the validation of geometries.
